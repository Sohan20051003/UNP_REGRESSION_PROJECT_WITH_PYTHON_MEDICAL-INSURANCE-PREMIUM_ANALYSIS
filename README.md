# UNP_REGRESSION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_MEDICAL-INSURANCE-PREMIUM_ANALYSIS

During my internship at United Network of Professionals, I worked on a Regression Project using Python to analyze and predict medical insurance premiums. The project involved end-to-end implementation — from data cleaning and preprocessing (handling duplicates, renaming columns, treating outliers) to exploratory data analysis using visualizations to study how factors like age, BMI, smoking status, and region affect charges. Three machine learning algorithms — Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest — were applied to build predictive models. Their performance was compared using evaluation metrics such as R² score, MAE, MSE, MAPE and RMSE to determine the most accurate model. This project enhanced my practical understanding of supervised learning, feature correlation, and model evaluation, while improving my analytical and Python programming skills in real-world healthcare cost prediction.
